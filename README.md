# ASP.NET MVC Final Project

This document describes the **final project assignment** for the **ASP.NET MVC** course at Telerik Academy.

## Project Description

Design and implement an **ASP.NET MVC application**. It can be a discussion forum, blog system, e-commerce site, online gaming site, social network, or any other web application by your choice.

The application should have:
* **public part** (accessible without authentication)
* **private part** (available for registered users)
* **administrative part** (available for administrators only)

### Public Part

The **public part** of your projects should be **visible without authentication**.

This public part could be the application start page, the user login and user registration forms, as well as the public data of the users, e.g. the blog posts in a blog system, the public offers in a bid system, the products in an e-commerce system, etc.

### Private Part (Users only)

**Registered users** should have private part in the web application accessible after **successful login**.

This part could hold for example the user's profiles management functionality, the user's offers in a bid system, the user's posts in a blog system, the user's photos in a photo sharing system, the user's contacts in a social network, etc.

### Administration Part

**System administrators** should have administrative access to the system and permissions to administer all major information objects in the system, e.g. to create/edit/delete users and other administrators, to edit/delete offers in a bid system, to edit/delete photos and album in a photo sharing system, to edit/delete posts in a blogging system, edit/delete products and categories in an e-commerce system, etc.

## General Requirements

Your Web application should use the following technologies, frameworks and development techniques:
* Use **ASP.NET MVC** and **Visual Studio 2015** with Update 1
* Have at least **15 controllers**
* Have at least **40 actions**
* You should use **Razor** template engine for generating the UI
	* You may use any JavaScript library of your choice
		* For example Kendo UI widgets (with the ASP.NET MVC Wrappers), Chart.js for charts, etc.
	* ASP.NET WebForms is not allowed
	* Use at least **3 sections** and at least **10 partial views**
	* Use at least **10 editor or display templates**
* Use **MS SQL Server** as database back-end
	* Use **Entity Framework 6** to access your database
	* Using **repositories and/or service layer** is a must
* Use at least **2 areas** in your project (e.g. for administration)
* Create **tables with data** with **server-side paging and sorting** for every model entity
	* You can use Kendo UI grid, jqGrid, any other library or generate your own HTML tables
* Create **beautiful and responsive UI**
	* You may use **Bootstrap** or **Materialize**
	* You may change the standard theme and modify it to apply own web design and visual styles
* Use the standard **ASP.NET Identity System** for managing users and roles
	* Your registered users should have at least one of the two roles: **user** and **administrator**
* Use **AJAX form and/or SignalR** communication in some parts of your application
* Use **caching** of data where it makes sense (e.g. starting page)
* Use **Ninject** (or any other dependency container) and **Automapper**
* Write at least **30 unit tests** for your logic, controllers, actions, helpers, routes, etc.
* Apply **error handling** and **data validation** to avoid crashes when invalid data is entered (both client-side and server-side)
* Prevent yourself from **security** holes (XSS, XSRF, Parameter Tampering, etc.)
	* Handle correctly the **special HTML characters** and tags like `<script>`, `<br />`, etc.
* Use GitHub and take advantage of the **branches** for writing your features.
* **Documentation** of the project and project architecture (as `.md` file, including screenshots)

### Optional Requirements (bonus points)

* Originality of the idea (uniqueness)
* Using some king of machine learning (AI)
* Using external devices (e.g. Raspberry Pi)
* Host your application in Azure (or any other public hosting provider)

### Deliverables

Put the following in a **ZIP archive** and submit it (**each team member** submits the same file):
* The **source code** (everything except /bin/, /obj/, /packages/)
* The project documentation
* Screenshots of your application
* If hosted online - the URL of the application

### Public Project Defense

Each student will have to make a **public defense** of its work to the trainers (in 15 minutes). It includes:
* Live **demonstration** of the developed web application (please prepare sample data).
* Explain application structure and its **source code**: ASPX pages, C# code, data-bindings, ASCX controls, etc.
* Show the **commit logs** in the source control repository to prove a contribution from all team members.
